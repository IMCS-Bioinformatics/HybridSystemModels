## ModelsMyeloidDifferentiation
Construction of state transition graphs for myeloid cell differentiation models defined in Prolog syntax.

Includes HSM models of myeloid cell differentiation. Each of the included Prolog files defines a particular version of the model and contains also rules (instructions) for generation of its state space. The Prolog interpreter for the models outputs their state spaces as simple text files, which can be further analysed by other tools. The programs are tested and compatible with SWI-Prolog (version 7.4.2).
